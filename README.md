# liri

Like siri but for text recognition.

While working on this project, I find myself thinking of how the front-end would look and what the utility of this app would be in the real world. I find it is a paradigm shift to code without seeing results that are like the web apps I look at everyday. I'm excited to see what else I learn as I continue this project.
