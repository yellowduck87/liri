# liri

Like siri but for text recognition.

While working on this project, I find myself thinking of how the front-end would look and what the utility of this app would be in the real world. I find it is a paradigm shift to code without seeing results that are like the web apps I look at everyday. I'm excited to see what else I learn as I continue this project. 

This project was not as exciting as other's I've worked on, but I think I still learned useful things. One thing was finding the right documentation for my application. THe NPM docs were what I ultimately needed to use twitter and spotify, but it took me a while to discover that. Spotify object have a ton of information associated with them, and drilling down to the part I needed took some trial and error, but once I got a few down the rest come more naturally. 

All in all, I would like this app to have a little more utility, but I'm glad I was able to complete it. I attempted to have the app write to a new log.txt, but I decided to move on instead.
